# import dependencies

# define a list of the categories (factors) which are part of the study

# pull in the merged and cleaned files which originally were separate years, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022

# confirm lack of NaN values before processing

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor SOCIAL SUPPORT/FAMILY

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor SOCIAL SUPPORT/FAMILY

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor HEALTH for the Healthy Life Expectancy

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor FREEDOM

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor GOVERNMENT TRUST (Perceptions of Corruption)

# made a DataFrame to support the Projections for the category/factor Generosity

### for each of these sections denoted by MarkDown sections in Jupyter Notebook, the following code exists

# create new DataFrames for analysis, projections are made with simple averages over the course of 5 years

## display the current data for years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022

## display the projected data for years 2022 1/2, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and our retirement year 2027

## year 2022 1/2 was created to smooth over the missing data from Kaggle for 2020 and 2021 and uses a simple average from the previous 5 years

## created a DataFrame to view the 5 happiest and 5 least happiest for each category/factor

# Created 3 pie charts to plot the following:

## Top 5 Countries in the Full Happiness Study which created scores utilizing more sophisticated algorithms than our project required, display table of teh Top 5 Countries

## Top 5 Countries in the Full Happiness Study aggregated by simply the individual factors (which do not add up to the Overall Happiness Score due to other algorithms applied during the process of analyzing the surveys

##), display the table of the Top 5 Countries

## Final pie chart displays our forecast of the Top 5 Countries to Retire in 2027 with a 5 year forecast over the individual categoeries/factors which we then aggregate for a total
