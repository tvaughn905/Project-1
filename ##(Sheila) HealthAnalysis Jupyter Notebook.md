# import dependencies

# define variables and lists for the years covered for analyzation and the year groups tested

# list the categories (factors) which are part of the study

# pull in the merged and cleaned files which originally were separate years, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022

# confirm lack of NaN values before processing

# made a DataFrame with simply the Health Score data to review the data

# made a DataFrame with simply the Overall Happiness Score data to review the data

# review the top 5 ranked countries from the averages over the Health Scores from 2015 through 2019

# review the top 5 ranked countries from the averages over the Health Scores from 2022

# output just the countries with complete happiness scores throught the years for planned api processing

# loop through the Health Happiness data for the data sets for 2015-2019 and for 2022 to created scatter plots of the Health vs Overall Happiness Scores

## in this loop the r-value, pvalue, and slope intercept is calculated and printed

# last , loop through the Overall Happiness Research, find the top 5 Overall Happy countries for the data sets for 2015-2019 and for 2022

## create a bar graph for each one
