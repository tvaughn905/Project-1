# Discovering the Best Places to Retire

Pulling data from the "World Happiness Report" from "kaggle", we will pull the top 5 countries to consider retiring to based on happiness levels considering six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. This project also considers pre-pandimc and post to output a forecast of the top 5 countries that retained their happiness ranks through one of the most difficult historic times.

list the categories (factors) which are part of the study
pull in the merged and cleaned files which originally were separate years, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022
confirm lack of NaN values before processing
made a DataFrame with simply the Health Score data to review the data
made a DataFrame with simply the Overall Happiness Score data to review the data
review the top 5 ranked countries from the averages over the Health Scores from 2015 through 2019
review the top 5 ranked countries from the averages over the Health Scores from 2022
output just the countries with complete happiness scores throught the years for planned api processing
loop through the Health Happiness data for the data sets for 2015-2019 and for 2022 to created scatter plots of the Health vs Overall Happiness Scores
in this loop the r-value, pvalue, and slope intercept is calculated and printed
last , loop through the Overall Happiness Research, find the top 5 Overall Happy countries for the data sets for 2015-2019 and for 2022
