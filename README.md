Project Title: Happiness Project 1 (temporary)

Project Description/Outline

Comparing countries happiness throughout the Covid years. Pre and post information. Creating a forecast from 2015 – 2019 data, then running correlations to the most recent years, including 2021 and 2022.

Title: (whatever name the group came up with).
Background: Used data from: World Happiness website found on Kaggle. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?resource=download (for 2015-2019 data years).
And
https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data (for 2022 data).
** All members of the group used the 2015-2019 and 2022 .csv files (downloaded).
I focused on the columns for measuring the amount of Freedom a country has had in correlation to their happiness levels. 
Description of Data Exploration:  I compiled the “Freedom” component/factor of the 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 data, cross-checking it with countries listed in the data set who have a recorded “level” of happiness.  Also did cross-checking on the 2022 yearly report of happiness data to freedom “levels” as well. 
Data Analysis:  I created dataframes and used a “clean” version of the merged .csv files that was jointly used by all members of the team.  Duplicate and “NaN” data was dropped out of the dataset.  
I created a dataframe of the “clean” combined .csv file, gathering the “Freedom 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022” data columns.  I created a second dataframe gathering the columns marked for “Happiness Score” for the years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022; also grabbing the “Country” names. Next, I created data loops going through country by country, year by year, a listing of the happiest freedom level countries, and also the worst of bottom of the list. I captured the percentage rates. I then created bar charts for each calendar year, showing the trend of “Happiness” and “Freedom” scores broken down by year, visually.  Next, I created scatter plots with the same data and included the regression line for each; again, year by year. Freedom versus Overall Happiness scores. Next, I created a second .ipnyb file where the original same combined, “cleaned” .csv data set was used, for the years (2015-2019), as one combined unit.  I found the average, (a/k/a “mean” scores for both “x”=Overall Happiness and “y”=”Average Freedom” scores. I created a scatter plot, showing the combined averages of “Overall Happiness” to “Freedom” scores and how they appear with a regressions line. A second scatter plot was also created, in a similar manner, but just with the 2022 data. I noticed the same 5 top countries kept appearing as the “Happiest for Freedom” of the bunch. They are (in order): Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Canada. 
Limitations of the dataset for future consideration:  I think this should be a combined group response.
Data source: I think this should be a combined group response as well.
